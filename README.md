# High-altitude balloon experiment

[Department of Radiation Dosimetry of the Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences](http://www.ujf.cas.cz/en/departments/department-of-radiation-dosimetry/contact/) high-altitude balloon experiment

## Realised flights 

There are [multiple FIK flights](http://www.ujf.cas.cz/cs/oddeleni/oddeleni-dozimetrie-zareni/lety-fik/)

### FIK-3

Outsourced flight. [Facebook launch video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=215540205671872).

### FIK-4

High-altitude balloon [flight FIK-4](https://github.com/ODZ-UJF-AV-CR/FIK-4-Kiruna) was realised in cooperation with  [ESRANGE space center](https://sscspace.com/ssc-worldwide/esrange-space-center/).

### FIK-5

[FIK-5](https://github.com/ODZ-UJF-AV-CR/FIK-5) flight avionics was almost completely redesigned in comparison of FIK-1 flight.  This flight was the one of the first usage of [PX4 based autopilot](https://px4.io/) in high-altitude-balloons experiment. 

### FIK-6

Avionics almost completely based on FMUv5 hardware. The PX4 firmware was extended by LoRa module and the first prototype of [TFSIK telemetry modem](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TFSIK01). 
There are also an improved versions of AIRDOS, measuring devices. The documentation is in separate [FIK-6 repository](https://github.com/ODZ-UJF-AV-CR/FIK-6). 

## Description
